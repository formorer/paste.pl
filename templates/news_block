        <p><strong>2026-01-05:</strong> Comprehensive Service Overhaul. We have modernized the backend using <strong>Mojolicious</strong> and integrated <strong>Debian/Salsa authentication</strong>. Authenticated users now enjoy relaxed rate limits and spam validation.</p>
        <p>To enhance privacy, <strong>public indexing is disabled</strong> (all pastes are hidden by default) and the legacy <strong>XML-RPC API</strong> has been retired. We have also deployed <strong>iocaine</strong> to protect against AI scrapers. Please note that paste retention is now strictly capped at <strong>90 days</strong>.</p>
